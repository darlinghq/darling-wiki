====== Darling Prefix ======

Darling prefix is a [[documentation:containerization|container]] overlayed on top of a base macOS-like root file system located in ''$installation_prefix/libexec/darling''. The default location is ''~/.darling'' and this can be controlled with the ''DPREFIX'' environment variable, very much like ''WINEPREFIX'' under Wine.

The container uses overlayfs along with a user mount namespace to provide a different idea of ''/'' for macOS applications.

When you run an executable inside the prefix for the first time (after boot), an init-like process representing the container is started. This init process keeps the root file system mounted. In future, Apple's ''launchd'' will be used for this purpose.

===== Updating the Prefix =====

Unlike Wine, Darling doesn't need to update the prefix whenever the Darling installation is updated. There is one caveat, though: since overlayfs caches the contents of underlying file system(s), you may need to terminate the container to see Darling's updated files:

<code>
darling shutdown
</code>

Note that this will terminate all processes running in the container.
