====== Roadmap ======

===== Low-Level =====

  * Have ELF (native Linux) code run inside ''/Volumes/SystemRoot''.
  * Extend the kernel module to produce Mach-O core dumps.
  * Enable macOS Homebrew to run (current hurdle: [[https://github.com/darlinghq/darling/issues/353|missing memberd]]).
  * Fix the [[https://github.com/darlinghq/darling/issues/368|bug]] with a single Mach port in multiple port sets.
